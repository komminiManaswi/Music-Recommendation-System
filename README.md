# MusicRecSYS
This project aims to utilize 
sophisticated algorithms and user profiling 
methods, gaining knowledge from two Kaggle 
datasets. Through the integration of user listening 
history with the nuances of music content, such as 
song titles, artist names, and lyrics, our goal is to 
develop a recommendation system that not only 
understands the nuances of musical preferences but 
also offers a customized exploration of the vast 
world of sound.Music recommendation system based on both content based and collaborative-based filtering methods

The following datasets were used in this project.
For content-based recommendations:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/notshrirang/spotify-million-song-dataset
For collaborative recommendation:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anuragbanerjee/million-song-data-set-subset

This initiative's main goal is to improve the 
experience of discovering music by addressing the 
inherent shortcomings of the current content-based 
and collaborative filtering methods. These 
restrictions include difficulties pertaining to the 
"cold start" issue and an apparent requirement for 
greater diversity in the results of recommendations 
[3]. The first pertains to how well the system can 
make recommendations for recently added items or 
new users, while the second is about how 
recommendations might be too specific and prevent users from exploring a wider range of musical 
genres and artists.
