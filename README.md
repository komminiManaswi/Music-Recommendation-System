# Music-Recommendation-System

This project aims to utilize 
sophisticated algorithms and user profiling 
methods, gaining knowledge from two Kaggle 
datasets. Through the integration of user listening 
history with the nuances of music content, such as 
song titles, artist names, and lyrics, our goal is to 
develop a recommendation system that not only 
understands the nuances of musical preferences but 
also offers a customized exploration of the vast 
world of sound.
